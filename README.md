# Conway's Game of Life

This project implements Conway's Game of Life using **C++** and **SFML** for rendering. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game evolves based on simple rules applied to a grid of cells, creating complex and interesting patterns.

## Features
- Randomized starting patterns.
- Real-time simulation of the game's evolution.
- Adjustable grid size and cell size.
- Interactive graphical display using **SFML**.

## Requirements
- **C++17 or later**.
- **SFML 2.5 or later**.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW, MSVC).
- CMake.

## How to Build
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ErlendTregde/Conway-s-Game-of-Life-c-.git
   cd Conway-s-Game-of-Life-c-
